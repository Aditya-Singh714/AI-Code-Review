❌ Bad Code: `javascript function sum(){ return a + b; } ` 🔍 Issues: - ❌ Function doesn't declare or define `a` and `b` which will cause an error or unexpected behavior. - ❌ Function doesn't accept any arguments. ✅ Recommended Fix: `javascript /** * Calculates the sum of two numbers. * @param {number} a - The first number. * @param {number} b - The second number. * @returns {number} The sum of a and b. */ function sum(a, b) { return a + b; } ` 💡 Why This Works Better: - ✔ The function now accepts two arguments `a` and `b`. - ✔ Includes a JSDoc comment explaining what the function does, what the parameters are, and what it returns. 🌟 Learning Tip: Always define your function parameters to make your code more predictable and less error-prone. Add JSDoc comments to improve readability and maintainability.
